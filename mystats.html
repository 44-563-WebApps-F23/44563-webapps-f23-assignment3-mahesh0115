<p>During my career, I've collaborated with engineers from around the world 
    on international infrastructure projects, fostering cross-cultural understanding 
    and sharing knowledge to solve complex engineering challenges.

<h2>Favourite Food - Pot Chicken</h2>
<p>  Pot chicken is slow-cooked, allowing the meat to become exceptionally
     tender and infused with flavor from the herbs, spices, and cooking 
     liquids used in the pot. This results in a delicious and satisfying meal.
